Do you take cream and sugar? If so then you might like some of our CoffeeScript delectables.

### Installing
<pre>
 $[sudo] npm install cream-and-sugar
</pre>

Well... we take that back.  Until the feel that there is enough value here we
are resisting the urge to publish to the npm public registry.  In the meantime

<pre>
  $git clone git@github.com:steelThread/cream-and-sugar.git
  $cd cream-and-sugar
  $[sudo] npm install  
</pre>

### Using
Simply
<pre>
 require 'cream-and-sugar'
</pre>

### Testing
<pre>
 $cake test
</pre>

### Contribute

If you want to contribute please feel free.  We (and by we I mean me) would appreciate any and all contributions.

Code  -> shoot me a pull request.

Ideas -> write up a todo on the issues list.
